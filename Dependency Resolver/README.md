# 🔗 Dependency Resolver

A small application for calculating **transitive dependencies** between items.  
Given a set of items with their direct dependencies, the program computes the **full list of dependencies** for each item.  
Optionally, it can also calculate **inverse dependencies** (i.e., determine the items that depend on a given one).
