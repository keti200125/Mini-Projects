# ðŸš€ SPACE 2025 â€” Cosmic Path Finder

A C# (.NET) console application that helps an astronaut navigate a hazardous asteroid field and return to the Space Station.  
Given a grid map with start (`S`), finish (`F`), open space (`O`) and asteroids (`X`), the program computes:

- total number of possible paths from `S` to `F` (moving up/down/left/right),
- the shortest path length,
- and prints the map with the shortest route numbered from `1` to `L`.

This repository contains a clear, testable implementation and optional helpers to export the shortest path as CSV and (optionally) send it by email.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Features

- Parse map sizes and grid from console or file input
- Count **all possible** paths (no revisiting the same cell in a single path)
- Find the **shortest path** and its length
- Print the map with the shortest path marked with sequential numbers
- Export shortest path as CSV report
- Send CSV report via SMTP
- Defensive programming and validation for map size and characters

## ðŸ“¥ Input Format

1. An integer `M` â€” number of rows (2 â‰¤ M â‰¤ 100)  
2. An integer `N` â€” number of columns (2 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 100)  
3. `M` rows, each containing `N` space-separated characters (`S`, `F`, `O`, `X`)

You can provide input either interactively (console) or via a text file redirected to the program.
